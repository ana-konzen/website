                <p class="header">what it is</p>
                <p>Artifact is a web platform that lets users upload an image of any artwork and displays similar
                    paintings from the (for now) <a href="https://www.artic.edu/" target="_blank">Art Institute of
                        Chicago’s</a> collection. It provides an easy way to explore related artworks based on
                    style,
                    composition, or subject.
                </p><br><br>
                <p class="header">how it works</p>
                <p>Artifact is a RAG model. The museum’s entire collection* was scraped and analyzed using the <a
                        href="https://api.artic.edu/docs/#quick-start" target="_blank">museum’s own data</a> and a
                    combination of the Artsy and Wiki APIs. The data is then stored in a vector database and used
                    for
                    querying.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="header">conservative use of AI</p>
                <p>The model could be easily scaled up using more museum APIs. The strings used for the embeddings
                    are
                    long enough for an accurate analysis, but short enough to be cost-effective. Each artwork
                    analysis
                    costs an average of 0.0012 cents to be embedded, meaning 100k artworks could be analyzed for a
                    little over one dollar.
