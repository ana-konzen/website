                <p class="header">the original rogue</p>
                <p>Published in 1980, Rogue is a dungeon-crawling video game. It differed itself from its contemporaries
                    by being
                    completely procedurally generated: no game is ever the same.</p>

                <p class="header">the ultimate rogue-like?</p>
                <p>I took Rogue’s original idea and amplified it by creating a terminal game that’s completely
                    automatically generated.
                    Nothing except its overall structure and design is ever the same.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="header">blend of aesthetics</p>
                <p>Although Dungeon Mystery uses cutting-edge technology, the design of it intentionally (and somewhat
                    ironically) mimics the aesthetic of 80s terminal games and the original Rogue.

                <p class="header">the game</p>
                <p>Dungeon Mystery follows a very simple structure: there are five chambers in the dungeon, each of them
                    with one character
                    and a locked door to the next chamber. The player must interact with the character—who has a
                    specific mission for the
                    player, be it a riddle or a question about what the player has learned so far—to gain their trust.
                    Once the character’s
                    trust is gained, the door to the next room is unlocked.</p>

                <p class="header">code structure</p>
                <p>When a new game is loaded, ChatGPT will create the structure for the game through a structured output
                    where it describes
                    the game’s overall plot as well as details about each character.
                    Every character has access to the basic information about the game and themselves, as well as a chat
                    history.
                    I leveraged ChatGPT’s Function calling capabilities to implement the trust score feature: every time
                    the player answers
                    something, the AI will decide whether the trust level increased, decreased, or remained the same—and
                    call the
                    appropriate function.</p>
