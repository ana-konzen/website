                <p>In the 1960s, Yves Klein started producing his <i>Anthropometries—elaborate</i> performances where
                    nude
                    models, covered in
                    Klein’s Blue, moved around the canvas while Klein’s <i>Monotone Symphony</i> played. The music,
                    which
                    consists of 20 minutes of
                    a persistent D major followed by 20 minutes of silence, served as a guide to the models. While the
                    major chord played,
                    the models were able to move and paint themselves in the canvas. During the silence, they stopped
                    moving.</p>

                <p>Several women participated in the production of the <i>Anthropometries</i>, but little focus has been
                    given to them throughout art history—they are seen as tools for the creation of the paintings, with
                    little
                    to no agency.
                    <br><br>
                    Yves Klein himself called them his “human brushes.”
                    <br><br>
                    “Reclaiming Klein” was thus born through a wish of reclaiming, or exposing, the point of view of the
                    women who made the <i>Anthropometries</i> come to life.

                <p>I leveraged two motion capture programs (Moves by Maxon and Rokoko Studio) and recorded myself moving
                    to the sound of <i>Monotone Symphony</i>. These captures were then used to create the final
                    composition.

                <p>The 3D rendering was created with Cinema4D and Redshift.
                    I mixed several of the motion captures to create the final composition and built a multi-camera set
                    up meant to mimic a
                    first-person perspective.</p>

                <p>After rendering, I composed the result in After Effects and added <i>Monotone Symphony</i>.<br>The
                    video
                    is meant as a tool for contemplation. I haven’t added much content or exposition, only the word
                    “reclaiming” in the beginning.</p>
